# Chatting with PDF Documents using Generative AI

## Overview
This lesson demonstrates how to use Generative AI to interact with PDF documents, enabling natural language conversations about their content. The implementation uses a combination of PDF text extraction and Large Language Models (LLMs) to create an intelligent document analysis system.

## Key Components

### 1. PDF Text Extraction
- **pdfplumber**: A Python library used to extract text from PDF documents
- **Text Processing**: Converts PDF content into machine-readable text format
- **Implementation**: 
  ```python
  def extract_text_with_pdfplumber(pdf_path):
      text = ""
      with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
          for page in pdf.pages:
              text += page.extract_text()
      return text
  ```

### 2. Large Language Model Integration
- **Groq LLM**: Used for natural language understanding and generation
- **Model Selection**: Utilizes the llama3-70b-8192 model for high-quality responses
- **Key Features**:
  - Text summarization
  - Question answering
  - Contextual understanding

### 3. Core Functionalities

#### a. Text Summarization
- **Purpose**: Generate concise summaries of PDF content
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def summarize_text(text):
      response = llm.complete(f"Summarize the text: {text}")
      return response
  ```
- **Use Cases**:
  - Quick document overview
  - Executive summaries
  - Content analysis

#### b. Question Answering
- **Purpose**: Answer specific questions about PDF content
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def ask_question(text, question):
      response = llm.complete(f"Based on the following text: {text}, answer: {question}")
      return response
  ```
- **Features**:
  - Context-aware responses
  - Natural language understanding
  - Precise information retrieval

## Technical Concepts

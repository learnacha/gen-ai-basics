# Setting Guardrails for LLMs in Generative AI Applications

## Introduction
Guardrails in Large Language Models (LLMs) are essential safety measures that help control and direct the model's behavior, ensuring it operates within defined boundaries and maintains appropriate responses. This lesson demonstrates how to implement effective guardrails using a practical example of a specialized chatbot.

## Key Concepts

### 1. System Prompts as Guardrails
- **Definition**: System prompts are instructions given to the LLM that define its role, limitations, and behavior boundaries.
- **Example**: In the lesson's chatbot, the system prompt clearly defines:
  ```python
  "You are a chat bot designed only to answer questions about cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. You do not know anything else. If someone asks questions on topics apart from Sachin Tendulkar, just say you don't know."
  ```
- **Purpose**: This creates a strict boundary for the model's knowledge domain and response behavior.

### 2. Response Control
- **Token Limitation**: Setting `max_tokens=4096` helps prevent excessively long responses.
- **Role Definition**: Using the "system" and "user" roles in messages helps maintain clear conversation context.
- **Response Filtering**: The model is instructed to explicitly state when it doesn't know something outside its domain.

### 3. Implementation Components
- **Environment Variables**: Secure handling of API keys using `.env` files
- **Model Selection**: Using specific models (e.g., `llama3-70b-8192`) with known capabilities
- **User Interface**: Streamlit-based interface that provides a controlled environment for user interaction

## Best Practices for Implementing Guardrails

1. **Clear Scope Definition**
   - Define specific domains of knowledge
   - Set explicit boundaries for responses
   - Include fallback responses for out-of-scope queries

2. **Security Measures**
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Control access to the application

3. **User Experience**
   - Provide clear instructions to users
   - Implement intuitive interfaces
   - Include proper error messages and guidance

## Practical Applications
The lesson demonstrates these concepts through a Sachin Tendulkar chatbot that:
- Only responds to cricket-related queries
- Maintains a professional tone
- Provides clear boundaries for its knowledge
- Offers a user-friendly interface

## Conclusion
Setting guardrails for LLMs is crucial for:
- Maintaining control over model behavior
- Ensuring appropriate responses
- Protecting against misuse
- Creating reliable and safe AI applications

By implementing these guardrails, developers can create more reliable and controlled AI applications that serve specific purposes while maintaining safety and appropriateness.
